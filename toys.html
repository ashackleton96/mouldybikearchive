								My sister was the shiny new robot <br />That Amsterdam craved. They wanted to play<br />  With all the wit, speed, and superpowers<br /> She had. All of that which was taken for<br />  Granted in the land that stays ﬁxated<br /> On nineteen-sixteen. But they sent her on<br /> Too many far-away missions; too much<br /> Time with other robots ‘til she missed her  Placid teddies with the emerald eyes. <br /> So she came back home.
							</p>
							<p>
								My best friend in school was the fastest grey<br />  Race car I’ve ever met. Speeding between <br /> Her careful, articulate English and  <br />Her rapid, passionate Polish, she built <br /> The motorway between her imposed home <br /> And her memory of home. Sometimes she<br /> Has two homes, sometimes she has one or none. <br /> Sometimes she has a pit stop and nothing<br /> More. Her wheels keep spinning; directionless.<br /> She’s looking for home.
							</p>
							<p>
								That Syrian boy who sat in the back<br />  Of an ambulance is a rag doll. He <br />Watches the war-ﬁgurines clash and boom <br /> With each other. His fabric arms ﬂop and <br /> His marble eyes can’t cry. He has been tossed <br /> And thrown in games of no pretending, but<br />  Now the game-maker has no interest in<br /> Building a new world for him. The rag doll<br /> Hopes to create a new home for himself<br /> But can’t lift his arms.
