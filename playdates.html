							<h2>Playdates</h2>

						<section class="wrapper style5">
							<div class="inner">
							<p>
								Me and Joe used to invite friends over after school<br /> under false pretences.
							</p>
							<p>
								We promised we’d play tip the can.<br /> We promised we’d play football. <br />Instead we had them act in short ﬁlms<br /> which we co-wrote as we went.
							</p>
							<p>
								We had Reilly stripped to the waist<br />  on location in the ruins of a nearby famine village.<br /> He played a superhero <br /> doing push-ups in some long-dead family’s living room,<br /> swinging from trees in their garden.
							</p>
							<p>
								He protested and protested<br />  said it was stupid and none of his other friends did this <br /> but he was outnumbered and lacking vision.
							</p>
							<p>
								Liam played a crazed puppeteer<br />   in a documentary charting his rise and fall.<br /> We taped socks to his hands for the puppets.<br />  When the fame gets too much, the puppeteer unravels,<br />  so we pinned him down and tickled<br />   until the madness came through.
							</p>
							<p>
								Working with amateurs proved frustrating.<br />  Little Michael was useless as a Western lead. <br /> Blind without his glasses, devoid of charisma, timid as shit<br />  we had him smoke ﬁve of my father’s John Majors<br />  until his performance developed some grit.
							</p>
							<p>
								Quiet Ken was awarded our most challenging role-<br /> unable to convince us he was not a method actor<br /> he mimed the Velvet Underground’s ‘White Heat. White Light.’ <br />into a blinking lens for three and a half hours<br /> until he ﬁnally winked at the right time.<br /> Then we made him drop acid, strip to his jocks<br /> and cluck like a chicken in the coop<br />  with the rest of the chickens.<br /> Then we made him lay an egg.
							</p>
							<p>
								Brendan got bit by an aggravated dog<br /> in a failed escape from the plantation.<br /> Brian took the beatings like a silent champ<br />  in a piece which tackled domestic abuse.<br /> Timothy refused to do the shower scene.<br /> William cried and went home.
							</p>
							<p>
								Mom found the videos and deleted them all,<br /> Rang Joe’s mother and a counsellor. <br />Now I don’t see Joe anymore <br />and nobody comes over after school. <br />Tip the can is shit alone <br />so I kick the ball through every window in the house<br /> and go inside to watch Le Regle du Jeu.

								<h2>Cars and Dismissal</h2>
								<p>By Leah Keane</p>

								<p>
									Where some families have a dining room<br />to talk about big issues, the Keane family has the car.
								</p>
								<p>
								Not one car necessarily, different ones<br /> over the years, each one slightly less shitty than the last,
								</p>
								<p>
									and the thing is<br />  that you’re in cars a lot,<br /> so it could happen at any time really.
								</p>
								<p>
									Maybe one trip you’re just in the mood<br /> to talk to your Mam about the fact that you love boobs.
								</p>
								<p>
									Or a bit drunk, she’s driving you home from the pub <br />and it slips out — that you really really like it when girls get their nips out.
								</p>
								<p>
									You see the real thing is<br /> that you don’t believe in big issues <br />and you often talk in monotone,
								</p>
								<p>
									so it’s quite likely that this is how the conversation would go:
								</p>
								<p>
									“Well.”
								</p>
								<p>
									“Well.”
								</p>
								<p>
									“Were ye busy today?”
								</p>
								<p>
									“Ah. It was alright.”
								</p>
								<p>
									Seat belts on then silence for ten minutes.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are some poorly kept bushes on a roundabout.
								</p>
								<p>
									It reminds you of your own poorly kept bush.
								</p>
								<p>
									“Mam, I think I’m gay.”
								</p>
								<p>
									I don’t think she’d mind.
								</p>
								<p>
									One night she was drunk, <br />  ended up coming home at around three o’ clock. <br /> I was in bed in my brother’s room downstairs<br />  because I thought I heard mice in the attic.
								</p>
								<p>
									I heard her rummaging around in the kitchen for a while.<br />  Then she was on the phone with someone,<br />  so she went outside the backdoor to have a smoke — <br /> a habit of hers since I can remember.
								</p>
								<p>
									Later she must have noticed <br />that an extra light was on downstairs,<br /> so in she came and sat down<br /> half on top of me by the edge of the bed.
								</p>
								<p>
									And oh how she lamented.<br /> She’d had a horrible lovers’ quarrel<br /> with her partner of nearly twenty years — <br />a retired Eircom installation man, <br />who loves taking her out to dinner on Strand Hill<br /> and talking about his bladder and the neighbours.
								</p>
								<p>
									And I said, “Sure you’ll get back together.”
								</p>
								<p>
									“No, no. Not this time.”
								</p>
								<p>
									She let out a drunken sigh.
								</p>
								<p>
									“Promise me, Leah that when you get a bit older<br />  you’ll marry a nice, rich man who’ll take care of yo<br /> u and then you’ll never have to work a day in your life. <br />  A man…
								</p>
								<p>
									or a woman, I don’t care, as long as you’re happy.”
								</p>
								<p>
									Of course they got back together two weeks later,<br /> but those words gave me enough <br /> to make me feel secure.

								</p>
								<p>
									The Keane family has the car for big issues.<br /> Like that time when I was nine<br /> And Mam told me that Nana was dying.
								</p>
								<p>
									Out she came with it, in a calm, sympathetic voice, “Leah,<br />  Nana’s very sick and she’s not going to get better.”
								</p>
								<p>
									I had been sitting in the back seat,<br />  and when I started crying <br /> she urged me to come crawl into the front<br /> where she hugged me very gently against her<br /> with one arm around my shoulders<br /> and the other resting ﬁrmly on the wheel —<br /> all the while she never stopped driving.
								</p>
								<p>
									I’m not worried about being excommunicated,<br /> not from any church or even from my own family.<br /> I suppose my biggest fear is dismissal.<br /> You always hear talk about “phases”,<br /> and as someone who has seemingly no solid foundations for what I feel, <br />that fear is all too legitimate.<br />  I’ve never kissed a girl or even been in a proper relationship.
								</p>
								<p>
									So the problem is, <br />how does one communicate a fact without any sources?

								</p>
								<p>
									It’s more difﬁcult.<br /> She’ll ask, “Well, where’s this woman then?” <br />and I’d rather avoid all that.
								</p>
								<p>
									So should I come out now<br />  or wait until I’ve met a girl<br /> who’d like to drink tea with me <br />and watch bad TV.
								</p>
								<p>
									A girl who’s sweet enough not to cringe<br /> when she reads my poetry,<br /> and would not be opposed<br /> to having sex in weird places
								</p>
								<p>
									Or drinking in quiet bars<br /> that play the Rolling Stones,
								</p>
								<p>
									And if you haven’t dismissed me yet,<br /> I promise to propose as soon as I get my car.
								</p>

								<h2>Shared Toys</h2>
								<p>By Ruth Ennis</p>


								<p>
									My sister was the shiny new robot <br />That Amsterdam craved. They wanted to play<br />  With all the wit, speed, and superpowers<br /> She had. All of that which was taken for<br />  Granted in the land that stays ﬁxated<br /> On nineteen-sixteen. But they sent her on<br /> Too many far-away missions; too much<br /> Time with other robots ‘til she missed her  Placid teddies with the emerald eyes. <br /> So she came back home.
								</p>
								<p>
									My best friend in school was the fastest grey<br />  Race car I’ve ever met. Speeding between <br /> Her careful, articulate English and  <br />Her rapid, passionate Polish, she built <br /> The motorway between her imposed home <br /> And her memory of home. Sometimes she<br /> Has two homes, sometimes she has one or none. <br /> Sometimes she has a pit stop and nothing<br /> More. Her wheels keep spinning; directionless.<br /> She’s looking for home.
								</p>
								<p>
									That Syrian boy who sat in the back<br />  Of an ambulance is a rag doll. He <br />Watches the war-ﬁgurines clash and boom <br /> With each other. His fabric arms ﬂop and <br /> His marble eyes can’t cry. He has been tossed <br /> And thrown in games of no pretending, but<br />  Now the game-maker has no interest in<br /> Building a new world for him. The rag doll<br /> Hopes to create a new home for himself<br /> But can’t lift his arms.

								<h2>A Co(s)mic Foray on the Inﬁnitude<br/>

								written for landscape</h2>
								<p>By Daniel Mulcahy</p>

								<p>
									Within the clasp-shut suitcase is
								</p>
								<p>
									a bag of balloons: <br />deﬂatable moons
								<p>
								Inside of which<br /> are clowncars stuffed with<br />  collapsible bikes like crumpled <br /> leaves scabbed with the corpses of nuclear <br /> submarines in psychedelic yellow tones
								</p>
								<p>
									within which squat scuff-haired <br />children squinting beneath bulbous <br /> brows downwards upon a sparsely forested
								</p>
								<p>
									Mountainrange with fully integrated<br />  billygoats eating tiny smoke-chimblied thatched<br />  chalets on whose scratchy roofs perch a motley assortment of<br /> crows infested by dogs sporting fashionable pouches full of cats and cat <br />kindred that purvey <br /> stalls selling recreational vehicles and cloakrooms and too many haberdashers <br />to count not to mention the
								</p>
								<p>
									towers of precarious jelly tots and vegetarian confectionary and bon bons and <br />pom-poms and human skulls that crowd around the <br /> spirits of homeopathists juggling elephants and ziggurats ﬂailing towards the<br /> zeppelin-bathed metropolis ﬂoating high beneath the fountains of <br />Living light streams scintillating across a grimace of cloud –
								</p>
								<p>
									shooting over goathorns and mountaintops<br /> sneezing out of noses and portholes and valveholes and glovecompartments,<br />  swelling out of the moon until it fair seemed ﬁt to burst
								</p>
								<p>
									beyond the span of the suitcase lid that never  <br />
									                                               could<br />
									                                                  quite<br />

								<h2>An Attempt to Keep Up with A Champion </h2>
								<p>By Morag Dine</p>

								<p>
									I can’t remember the last time my shoulder didn’t hurt <br />  First steps after sleep crunch<br />   And  <br /> Click <br />  And it takes the morning for my bones to warm up<br />  Still<br />   My body’s movements mesmerise even me<br />   Springboard ﬂooring softens the arthritic blow<br />  Mirrored walls allow for perfection of extension and <br />  I’m still trying to get the perfect French whip
								</p>
								<p>
									Stunted growth gave way to shin splints<br />  A pointed ﬁnger in my back gave in to cancer <br />  But at least he corrected my carriage before he left
								</p>
								<p>
									I remember
								</p>
								<p>
									Dancing on concrete with nothing to protect young bodies from fracture but <br /> leather just thick enough to be opaque <br />  We weren’t allowed to dance outside <br />   Not because it was damning <br />   But because  <br />  It would ruin our pumps
								</p>
								<p>
									My toes click as loud now as my heels once did in heavy shoes <br />  Jigs and reels distort into being told I was too fat to be a champion<br />  Too huge to jump high <br />  But my kicks were stronger than any fairy <br />  My strength too wonderful to be controlled <br />  A pre-pubescent powerhouse  <br /> Suffocated with wigs and legs of mahogany
								</p>
								<p>
									I let rip
								</p>
								<p>
									The ﬁrst time I danced to cry was my rebirth  <br />   I didn’t care about being too sore to compete  <br />   Who cares about trophies when you can make such beauty <br />  with only your  <br /> Pained  <br />  Tender <br />  Feet
